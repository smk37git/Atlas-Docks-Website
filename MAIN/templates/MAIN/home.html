                    Atlas Docks, LLC builds strong, quality residential and commercial docks that are made for 
                    endurance in all sizes and shapes. Our docks are engineered and designed for their location. We 
                    specialize in transferring loads in a way that prevents failure. The experience that we have in this 
                    area is what separates Atlas Docks from the rest of the field. Our intent is to build and install the 
                    perfect product for any application ~ any alternative is not an option for us.

                    We have an in-house drafting department, as well as engineers that we work closely with to provide 
                    the best atmosphere to supersede the creation of the customers' vision. Our knowledgeable, 
                    experienced staff has seen just about every scenario and will analyze your site conditions to

                        Our repairs are done with the intent to leave you stronger and more ready for all applicable 
                        conditions. We pre-correct any issues in the fabrication process to prevent breakage in the future. 
                        We can also help with lifts, electric, storage, stair towers, concrete piers, cable attachments, boat 
                        salvage, catastrophe remediation and much more.

                        Our additions are designed to not only meet the customers' needs, but also to increase the integrity 
                        of the floating marine structure, NOT create a weak point where added on to. We pay close attention 
                        to detail and make every effort to prevent the appearance of an addition. We will match weathered 
                        wood, custom build framework, special mix paint or any number of alternatives to achieve this goal.

                        Atlas does not weld the break and slap a piece of angle or scab on for reinforcement; we pay 
                        attention to the actual cause of the problem. We fix the problem with an actual solution so that it will 
                        not break anymore. We aim to protect our customer's investment and to protect them from 
                        spending money on reoccurring damages.

                    more stringent. At that time we were required to build an engineered product, and pass actual 
                    structural requirements to be certified.

                    have design standards that we believe in and build by. We are a fully insured, bonded dock builder
